# Useful software list

This list contains applications I use every day on Windows systems. Most of it are tried and well known open source projets. I create list to remember what tools I have used and tried in past.

I prefer open source projects, as they are more secure and transparent. So even if there is better tool free, but not open source I lean toward using open source. 


## Open source software

This list contains open source projects that are mature and, at same time, are actively developed and maintained.
